#  Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis  

##  Project Summary  
Instacart, an online grocery retailer, required exploratory analysis of customer and sales data. While Instacart performs well in terms of sales, stakeholders requested **deeper insights into customer purchasing behaviour** to support a more targeted marketing strategy.  

This project focused on:  
- Understanding **customer segmentation**  
- Identifying **shopping patterns**  
- Providing actionable recommendations for **personalised marketing campaigns**  

These insights aim to help Instacart tailor marketing strategies to customer profiles, thereby improving **sales performance** and **customer engagement**.
